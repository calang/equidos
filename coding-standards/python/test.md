# Python unit tests

All unit tests should follow these guidelines:
- stored in test subdirectory
- named test_*.py
- use pytest framework
- use descriptive names for test functions
- use fixtures for setup/teardown
- test one thing per function
- use assertions to validate behavior
- mock external dependencies
- aim for high coverage
