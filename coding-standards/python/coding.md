# Python Coding

## [Core Python Standards (PEP 8)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
- Indentation with 4 spaces.
- Limit lines to 79 characters.
- Two blank lines before top-level functions/classes; one blank line inside classes for methods.
- Naming conventions: snake_case for functions/variables, CamelCase for classes, UPPERCASE for constants.
- Proper spacing: no space before commas/colons; spaces after commas; spaces around operators.
- Imports should be grouped by standard library, third-party, then local imports at the top of the file.

## Best Practices for Clean Code
- Use descriptive, concise names for variables and functions.
- Prefer list comprehensions and generator expressions for concise, readable loops.
- Utilize Python's built-in libraries and functions for common tasks.
- Avoid repeating code by refactoring reusable parts into functions or classes.
- Handle exceptions properly for critical situations.
- Write documentation for methods and modules.

## Shebang
Use `#!/usr/bin/env python3` for scripts to ensure compatibility across environments.
